This is Acme Planner, our D02 project in Design & Testing II. We are implementing several functionalities like Shouting and Task control.
During the review of 03/05/2021 we talked with Mr. Rafael Corchuelo about a bug in the framework. There is a bug in which workflow-delete does not perform validations and therefore there is no way to check if a task associated to a workplan can or cannot be deleted. This causes that you always end up in panic.
