This is Acme Planner, our D02 project in Design & Testing II. We are implementing several functionalities like Shouting and Task control.

During the review of 03/05/2021 we talked with Mr. Rafael Corchuelo about a bug in the framework. There is a bug in which workflow-delete does not perform validations and therefore there is no way to check if a task associated to a workplan can or cannot be deleted. This causes that you always end up in panic.

As requested in the course, the publication has been made in CleverCloud. Both us and many other students have had many problems, starting with typos in the slides where the steps to follow were explained to failures of CleverCloud itself that does not show views that in the project work without any problems.

We think that some of these problems may be due to using /manager/ as address, since TomCat servers use that range as reserved address, but other sites such as the Dashboard of the administrator stop working in clever for no apparent reason. In the code requested in the requirements everything works without any problem.
