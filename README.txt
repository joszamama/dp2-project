This is Acme Planner, our D02 project in Design & Testing II. We are implementing several functionalities like Shouting and Task Management.

BUGS:

In the testing suite, super.navigate does not accept parameters in the URL, so it is impossible to 
request the URL of any task. In this case, we have used super.driver, which is a low-level function.
However, this is the only way to do it without changing the framework.
